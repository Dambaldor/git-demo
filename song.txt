sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall

Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill

We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in savage game
Our spirits, spears and shields are linked
In a much stronger chain

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls

All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall

All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls

All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!
We shall destroy!
